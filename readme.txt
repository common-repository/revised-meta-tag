Insert Revised Meta tag and display Last updated / Last modified date & time in WordPress Posts and Pages.

== Description ==

The "meta revised tag" is used to tell Search Engine Bots (Google, Yahoo!, Bing etc.) the Last Modified Date and Time of any Webpage in which you have made certain changes.

Web crawlers can then decide, whether there’s any need to save a new copy of the webpage OR update their indexes?

Example of a Meta revised tag:

`&lt;meta name="revised" content="Sunday, April 21, 2013, 2:59 am" /&gt;`
